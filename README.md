## What do the names mean?

Its always something like `version_modname.zip` or `version.zip` or `version/`

- `steam_frozz.zip`
  - Steam is version, release 146
  - Frozz is mod name, frozen forest

- `25013.zip`
  - 25013 is bleeding edge version
  - Without a mod name, it means no global mods are used

- `steam/`
