# It's a repository with saves for Mindustry, that's all.

## What do the names mean?

Its always something like `version_modname.zip` or `version.zip`

- `steam_frozz.zip`
  - steam is version, release 146
  - frozz is mod name, frozen forest

- `25013.zip`
  - 25013 is bleeding edge version
  - without a mod name, it means no global mods are used
